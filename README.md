# PDC-Assignment
This repository contains the PDC summer school assignment. The project aims to parallelize the Hybrid Lubrication Granular Dynamics (HLGD) model on both CPU and GPU.

    1-vesicle_v2_Seq-CPU: This is the sequential version of the code.
    2-vesicle_v2_OMP-CPU: This is the parallel version of the code for CPU cores using OpenMP.
    3-vesicle_v2_OMP-GPU: This is the parallel version of the code for the GPU using OpenMP.
